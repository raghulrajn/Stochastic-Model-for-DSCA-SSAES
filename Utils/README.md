# Methods to identify the leakage points 

## Test vector Leakage Assesment (TVLA)  
TVLA is a statistical method used in Differential Power Analysis (DPA) to detect side-channel leakage in cryptographic devices. By comparing power traces from fixed (e.g., all-zero) and random plaintext inputs using Welchâ€™s t-test, TVLA identifies significant differences in power consumption that may indicate vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks. This implementation processes 10,000 traces per group, computing t-statistics to highlight leakage points where |t| > 4.5, with visualization via Matplotlib.
